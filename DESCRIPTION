Title: Combined Dataset of Elemental X-ray Line Properties
Version: 0.1.1.9000
Author: Taha Ahmed
Maintainer: Taha Ahmed <taha@chepec.se>
Description: Dataset of X-ray line (transition) and edge energies, natural line
    widths, and fluorescence yields for the elements Z=4 (Be) to Z=103 (Lr).
    This package also provides a matching algorithm that given a set of energies
    can suggest the most closely matching elemental transitions based on some
    simple heuristics.
